## 3. Team Bios

### Maximilian H. — Founder & CEO

Maximilian started AcaiStack with a simple belief: businesses deserve honest
partners, not slick salespeople. With a background in full-stack development and
a passion for AI, he leads the team's vision and handles client relationships.
When he's not coding or strategizing, you'll find him hiking in the Bavarian
Alps or experimenting with new AI tools. He's the one who answers your
emails—yes, the actual founder.

**Skills:** Full-Stack Development, AI Integration, Business Strategy **Fun
fact:** Built his first website at 14

### Alexander H. — Co-Founder & Backend Developer

Alexander is the engine behind everything you don't see. He architects our
backend systems, builds our APIs, and makes sure everything runs fast and
secure. With deep expertise in databases, cloud infrastructure, and system
design, he's the reason our products scale without breaking. Quiet but
razor-sharp, Alex believes good code should be invisible—it just works.

**Skills:** APIs, Databases, Cloud Infrastructure, Security **Fun fact:** Can
debug production issues in his sleep

### Moritz H. — Co-Founder & Full Stack Developer

Moritz bridges the gap between design and functionality. As our full-stack
developer, he turns ideas into working products, from pixel-perfect frontends to
robust backend logic. He's obsessed with clean code and user experience, and
he's probably refactoring something right now. Moritz brings creative
problem-solving to every project and isn't satisfied until it feels right.

**Skills:** Frontend, Backend, UI/UX, Performance **Fun fact:** Refactored the
same function 47 times once

## 5. FAQ Content

### Pricing & Payment

**Q: How much does a website cost?** A: Our websites range from €1,499 to €2,999
depending on complexity. A simple landing page or small business site starts at
€1,499. More complex sites with custom features, integrations, or e-commerce
functionality fall in the higher range. We'll give you an exact quote after
understanding your needs—no surprises later.

**Q: How do payments work?** A: We keep it simple: 50% upfront to start the
project, 50% upon completion before launch. For larger projects, we can arrange
milestone-based payments. We accept bank transfer, credit card, and PayPal.

**Q: Are there hidden fees?** A: No. The price we quote is the price you pay. We
don't charge extra for revisions within our scope, for meetings, or for "project
management." If something might cost extra (like additional pages or features
beyond the original scope), we discuss it with you first.

**Q: What payment methods do you accept?** A: Bank transfer (SEPA), credit/debit
cards, and PayPal. For larger projects, we can discuss other arrangements.

**Q: Do you offer payment plans?** A: For projects over €3,000, we can split
payments into 3 milestones. Just ask.

---

### Process & Timeline

**Q: How long does a project take?** A: Most websites take 2-3 weeks from
kickoff to launch. Simple sites can be ready in 2 weeks, while more complex
builds may take 4 weeks. AI agents can be deployed in as little as 24-48 hours
since they're pre-built.

**Q: How many revisions do I get?** A: You get 2 rounds of revisions included in
every project. In practice, we work closely with you during development, so most
clients don't need more. If you do, additional revisions are billed at a
reasonable hourly rate—but honestly, it rarely comes to that.

**Q: What do you need from me to start?** A: Content (text and images for your
site), brand assets (logo, colors if you have them), and clarity on your goals.
We'll guide you through everything in our kickoff call.

**Q: How do I communicate with you?** A: Email, Slack, or video calls—whatever
works best for you. You'll always talk directly to the developer working on your
project, not an account manager.

**Q: What happens if I need changes after launch?** A: Every project includes 30
days of free support for bug fixes and minor adjustments. After that, we offer
optional maintenance plans starting at €99/month, or you can reach out anytime
for one-off updates.

---

### Websites

**Q: What tech stack do you use?** A: We build with modern, proven technologies:
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and frameworks like React or Next.js when needed. For
backends, we use Node.js, Python, and cloud platforms like AWS or Vercel. We
choose what's best for your project, not what's trendy.

**Q: Will I own the code?** A: Yes, 100%. Once the project is complete and paid
for, everything we build belongs to you—the design, the code, all of it. We'll
hand over all files and credentials. It's your business, so it's your property.

**Q: Is hosting included?** A: We set up hosting for you (usually on Vercel or a
similar modern platform), but hosting costs are separate. Most small sites cost
€0-20/month to host. We'll explain your options during the project.

**Q: Can I update the website myself?** A: If you want a CMS (content management
system), we can set that up. This lets you edit text, images, and blog posts
without touching code. Just let us know during the quote phase.

**Q: Is the website SEO-optimized?** A: Yes. Every website includes basic SEO:
proper meta tags, semantic HTML, fast loading times, and mobile optimization.
For more advanced SEO work (ongoing content strategy, link building), we can
recommend partners.

---

### AI Agents

**Q: How do AI agents work?** A: Our agents use large language models (like
GPT-4) trained on your specific use case. They connect to your existing
tools—website, CRM, calendar, email—and handle tasks automatically. You don't
need to understand AI; you just use them.

**Q: Do I need technical knowledge?** A: Not at all. We handle all setup and
integration. You just tell us what you want the agent to do, and we configure
it. We also provide training and documentation so your team feels confident.

**Q: What tools do agents integrate with?** A: Gmail, Outlook, Google Calendar,
Calendly, HubSpot, Salesforce, Slack, WhatsApp, and many more. If you use a tool
that's not on our list, ask—we can usually make it work.

**Q: Can I customize an agent?** A: Yes. While our agents are pre-built, we
configure them for your specific business, tone of voice, and workflows. For
truly unique use cases, we also build custom agents from scratch.

**Q: What support is included?** A: Every agent includes 30 days of support and
fine-tuning after deployment. If the agent isn't performing as expected, we fix
it. After 30 days, support continues if you're on a monthly plan, or you can
purchase support packages.

---

### Support & Guarantee

**Q: What happens after launch?** A: We don't disappear. Every project includes
30 days of free support for bug fixes and minor adjustments. We also offer
optional maintenance plans if you want ongoing updates, security patches, and
priority support.

**Q: Do you offer a money-back guarantee?** A: Yes. If you're not satisfied with
the initial design concept, we'll refund your deposit—no questions asked. We'd
rather part ways honestly than force a project that isn't working. That said,
this rarely happens because we align on expectations before we start.

**Q: How do I contact you?** A: Email hello@acaistack.com or use our contact
form. We respond within 24 hours, usually faster. For urgent issues, existing
clients get priority access.
