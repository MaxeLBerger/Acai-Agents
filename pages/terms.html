            <h2>3. Ordering & Payment</h2>

            <h3>3.1 Fixed Pricing</h3>
            <p>
              We offer transparent, fixed pricing for our services. The final price is agreed upon before any work
              begins and is documented in your project proposal or invoice. There are no hidden fees or surprise
              charges.
            </p>

            <h3>3.2 Payment Structure</h3>
            <p>For project-based services (websites and one-time AI agents), we use the following payment structure:</p>
            <div class="terms-highlight-box">
              <p><strong>50% Upfront:</strong> Due upon project acceptance to commence work.</p>
              <p><strong>50% On Delivery:</strong> Due upon project completion and your approval.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>3.3 Subscription Payments</h3>
            <p>
              For AI agent subscriptions, payment is billed monthly in advance. Subscriptions can be cancelled at any
              time with 30 days' notice, effective at the end of the current billing period.
            </p>

            <h3>3.4 Payment Methods</h3>
            <p>
              We accept bank transfers (SEPA), credit cards, and other payment methods as agreed upon. All prices are
              quoted in Euros (€) and include applicable taxes where required by German law.
            </p>

            <h3>3.5 Late Payments</h3>
            <p>
              If payment is not received within the agreed timeframe, we reserve the right to pause work until payment
              is received. Invoices overdue by more than 14 days may be subject to statutory interest under German law
              (§ 288 BGB).
            </p>

          <!-- 4. Delivery & Timeline -->
          <div id="delivery" class="terms-section">
            <h2>4. Delivery & Timeline</h2>

            <h3>4.1 Website Development Timeline</h3>
            <p>
              Standard website projects are completed within <strong>3 weeks</strong> from project kickoff, subject to
              timely provision of required materials and feedback from the client. The timeline may vary based on
              project complexity.
            </p>

            <h3>4.2 AI Agent Development Timeline</h3>
            <p>
              AI agent development timelines vary depending on complexity and integration requirements. Estimated
              delivery times will be provided in your project proposal. Typical timelines range from 1 to 4 weeks.
            </p>

            <h3>4.3 Project Milestones</h3>
            <p>We work with clear milestones and regular communication. You will receive:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Initial design concepts or prototypes for review</li>
              <li>Development previews at key stages</li>
              <li>Final review before launch or delivery</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4.4 Timeline Extensions</h3>
            <p>
              Delays caused by late feedback, missing content, or additional change requests from the client may extend
              the project timeline. We will communicate any timeline changes promptly.
            </p>

            <h3>5.1 Included Revisions</h3>
            <p>
              All projects include a reasonable number of revisions within the agreed scope. This typically includes:
            </p>

            <h3>5.2 Scope Changes</h3>

              Requests that fall outside the original project scope (such as additional pages, new features, or
              significant redesigns) may incur additional costs. We will always discuss and agree upon any additional
              charges before proceeding.
            </p>

            <h3>5.3 Revision Requests</h3>
            <p>To ensure efficient project delivery, we ask that revision requests be:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Consolidated into organized feedback rather than piecemeal requests</li>
              <li>Submitted within the agreed feedback timeframes</li>
              <li>Clear and specific to avoid misunderstandings</li>

              Some projects may include third-party components (such as fonts, icons, libraries, or plugins) that are
              licensed separately. These remain subject to their respective licenses, which we will clearly disclose.
            </p>

            <h3>6.4 Portfolio Rights</h3>
            <p>

              be recovered.
            </p>

            <h3>7.4 Subscription Refunds</h3>
